                <h2 class="project-text">Intro</h2>
                <p class="project-text">This summary offers a glimpse into the obstacles I faced while building this
                    intricate system, with a special focus on animation frames. My goal was to make the combat system
                    feel like real swordfights. Animation frames were at the core of this vision. They acted as the
                    timing for parry and block actions, like the beats in a song, making the combat feel authentic.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    In the next sections, we'll explore how I conceived and designed this system, and how animation
                    frames played a crucial role in bringing it to life. We'll also touch on the challenges I
                    encountered, as every big project comes with its hurdles. Throughout, remember that the magic of
                    game development often lies in the balance between vision and execution, with animation frames being
                    a key part of that equation.

                    Parrying and blocking stood at the core of the system, each posing its unique coding challenges. It
                    wasn't just about making them work; it was about coding them to align seamlessly with specific
                    animation frames. Players had to grapple with these techniques. To make the combat system more
                    engaging, I employed SphereCast within the code. This technique introduced a radius to parry and
                    block actions, making the combat interactions dynamic and responsive.

                        In the snippet above you can see the SphereCast being used when you press the parry button.

                        As you can see the radius of the SphereCast is around the player, so when the enemy does an
                        attack in that range you are able to block/parry it<br>

                <p class="project-text">
                    The job of the animator was to bring the combat system to life, ensuring that every action, from
                    parrying to striking, seamlessly blended with the gameplay. They were the architects of realism,
                    making the combat experience both engaging and immersive.

                    The posture damage system added a layer of complexity that was deeply tied to the world of animation
                    frames. For posture damage to make sense, parrying and strikes had to be executed within specific
                    frames. This was a coding challenge that required precision.
                </p>
                <p class="project-text">
                    Advanced collision detection was an integral part of the combat system. It allowed players to
                    experience precise interactions between their sword and an enemy's weapon. However, it operated
                    within the intricate framework of animation frames, making the coding journey all the more
                    challenging.

                    <p class="project-text">
                        In crafting the Advanced Melee Weapon Combat System, I uncovered the delicate balance between
                        art and science within game development. It beckons players to master precise timing while
                        challenging developers to unravel creative and coding complexities. Animation frames emerged as
                        the pivotal enablers, shaping an immersive combat experience.
