                                            The development of the game launcher in C# was quite a challenge, but I
                                            managed to make some great strides. I chose C# initially because it works
                                            well with the Unreal Engine, which is what I used for the game. I had to
                                            work with the WebClient class and the GitHub API to make the downloading and
                                            extraction process smooth.

                                            <br>

                                            At the beginning, I had to set up the environment carefully and make sure
                                            the UI components were working smoothly. One of the trickiest parts was
                                            getting the download feature right. I had to figure out how to handle file
                                            downloads, extractions, and potential errors. Adding the SaveFileDialog was
                                            a game-changer because it made it possible for users to choose where to save
                                            their downloads.

                                            various components, including the progress bar, necessitated persistent
                                            troubleshooting and diligent debugging efforts. Moreover, the intricate
                                            handling of exceptions, notably the NullReferenceException, demanded a
                                            comprehensive understanding of the code's intricacies and meticulous
                                            attention to detail.

                                            As we kept working, we ran into some issues with the progress bar and had to
                                            spend some time troubleshooting and debugging(The progress bar will be
                                            readded later). Dealing with exceptions like
                                            the NullReferenceException was a bit tricky, and we had to pay close
                                            attention to the details in the code.

                                            We also had some trouble with files getting locked during the build process.
                                            It taught us the importance of managing resources properly and handling file
                                            access carefully. We had to go deep into the build process to make sure

                                            Despite these challenges, we adopted an iterative approach, did a lot of
                                            testing, and learned a great deal about C# and the GitHub API. This project
                                            has really shown us the importance of perseverance, creative

                                    Developing the Tower Defense game in Unity presented various challenges that I
                                    successfully tackled. I opted for Unity as it provides a versatile platform for game
                                    development. Understanding the intricacies of the Unity engine and C# programming
                                    was
                                    fundamental in creating a smooth gaming experience. Implementing effective tower
                                    management systems and enemy AI were key highlights of the development process.

                                    Throughout the development phase, ensuring seamless integration of diverse game
                                    components such as tower mechanics, enemy behavior, and wave spawning required
                                    meticulous debugging and persistent testing. Handling complex AI behaviors and
                                    optimizing game performance were essential aspects that I focused on during the
                                    development process.

                                    The iterative approach adopted during the game's construction allowed for thorough

                                            exploration. Our collective aim was to deliver an immersive gaming
                                            experience that would resonate with players and push the boundaries of our

                                            During the development phase, my primary focus revolved around crafting the
                                            game's AI and defining its behavior to create an intense and gripping
                                            gameplay experience. Leveraging my expertise in AI programming, I dedicated
                                            myself to designing and implementing complex AI systems that were integral
                                            to the game's suspenseful and immersive atmosphere. I collaborated closely
                                            with the team to ensure that the AI seamlessly integrated with the game's
                                            narrative and mechanics, contributing to a cohesive and engaging player
                                            experience.

        <div class="aboutMe">
            <p>
                I'm an 18-year-old aspiring Unity/Unreal developer from Edam Volendam, Netherlands, living by the
                motto, "Aspire before you expire."
                My journey into the world of technology and software development
                began with a deep love for games and their profound impact on people's lives. Witnessing how games
                can
                spark joy, create connections, and even inspire, I was driven to explore the art of programming to
                create experiences that could touch people on a deeper level. Now, I'm seeking an internship in an
                environment that values effective workflow, hoping to further hone my skills and contribute to the world
                of game development with my creative ideas.
