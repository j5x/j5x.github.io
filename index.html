                                            BO-Space was a group assignment given to Game Developers and Artists
                                            to develop a game in 8 weeks and
                                            see
                                            what they could make with their current skills.
                                            I was in group 9. We worked on a Adventure Horror in game and as theme we
                                            had space.
                                            My part in this game was working on the AI and its behavior.

                                            The development of the game launcher in C# was quite a challenge, but I
                                            managed to make some great strides. I chose C# initially because it works
                                            well with the Unreal Engine, which is what I used for the game. I had to
                                            work with the WebClient class and the GitHub API to make the downloading and
                                            extraction process smooth.

                                            <br>

                                            At the beginning, I had to set up the environment carefully and make sure
                                            the UI components were working smoothly. One of the trickiest parts was
                                            getting the download feature right. I had to figure out how to handle file
                                            downloads, extractions, and potential errors. Adding the SaveFileDialog was
                                            a game-changer because it made it possible for users to choose where to save
                                            their downloads.

                                            As the development process unfolded, ensuring seamless compatibility of
                                            various components, including the progress bar, necessitated persistent
                                            troubleshooting and diligent debugging efforts. Moreover, the intricate
                                            handling of exceptions, notably the NullReferenceException, demanded a
                                            comprehensive understanding of the code's intricacies and meticulous
                                            attention to detail.

                                            As we kept working, we ran into some issues with the progress bar and had to
                                            spend some time troubleshooting and debugging(The progress bar will be
                                            readded later). Dealing with exceptions like
                                            the NullReferenceException was a bit tricky, and we had to pay close
                                            attention to the details in the code.

                                            We also had some trouble with files getting locked during the build process.
                                            It taught us the importance of managing resources properly and handling file
                                            access carefully. We had to go deep into the build process to make sure
                                            nothing was causing problems.

                                            Despite these challenges, we adopted an iterative approach, did a lot of
                                            testing, and learned a great deal about C# and the GitHub API. This project
                                            has really shown us the importance of perseverance, creative
                                            problem-solving, and paying attention to detail, especially in a

                                Tower Defense is a game i made in the first period of my second year at Mediacollege
                                Amsterdam.
                                <br>
                                The game was 10 weeks in Development, I learned how the unity instantiate system worked
                                and how component linking worked.
                                <br>
                                if you op my github then you can see all the struggles i went through in the making of
                                this project.

                                The project was a stepping stone to my improvement my development skills and I learned
                                alot from it.
