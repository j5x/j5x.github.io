                Amsterdam, following a software development course.
                <br>I live by my motto: Aspire before you Expire. It means you gotta do as much as you can before its
                too late.
                <br>My hobbies are boxing, basketball,video/sound editing and I also do some software development on the side. I am always trying to look ahead even when
                times are tough.
                I have the most experience with AI's but I am always down to learn new stuff and explore new things.
                <br>
                <br>
                My experiences are mainly:
                <br>
                - Unity
                <br>
                - C#
                <br>
                - Unreal Engine
