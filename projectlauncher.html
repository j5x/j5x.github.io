                    This project showcases the development of a Software launcher application in C#. The
                    primary objective of the application is to streamline the process of downloading, extracting, and
                    launching .exe applications.

                <p class="project-text">
                    The development of the game launcher in C# was quite a challenge, but I managed
                    to make some great strides. I chose C# initially because it works well with the Unreal Engine, which
                    is what I used for the game. I had to work with the WebClient class and the GitHub API to make the
                    downloading and extraction process smooth.
                </p>

                <p class="project-text">
                    At the beginning, I had to set up the environment carefully and make sure the UI components were
                    working smoothly. One of the trickiest parts was getting the download feature right. I had to figure
                    out how to handle file downloads, extractions, and potential errors. Adding the SaveFileDialog was a
                    game-changer because it made it possible for users to choose where to save their downloads.

                        In the image you can see the styling I used and how the buttons look. (I made them simple)

                <h2 class="project-text">Development</h2>
                <p class="project-text">
                    As the development process unfolded, ensuring seamless compatibility of various components,
                    including the progress bar, necessitated persistent troubleshooting and diligent debugging efforts.
                    Moreover, the intricate handling of exceptions, notably the NullReferenceException, demanded a
                    comprehensive understanding of the code's intricacies and meticulous attention to detail.
                </p>
                <p class="project-text">
                    As we kept working, we ran into some issues with the progress bar and had to spend some time
                    troubleshooting and debugging(The progress bar will be readded later). Dealing with exceptions like
                    the NullReferenceException was a bit tricky, and we had to pay close attention to the details in the
                    code.

                <h3 class="project-text">Technical Integration Challenges</h3>
                <p class="project-text">
                    The technical integration of the Google Drive API within the existing codebase proved to be more
                    complex than initially anticipated. It required additional external libraries and resources,
                    which
                    increased the complexity of the project.
                </p>
                <div class="project-images">
                    <p class="image-title">The Google Drive API script</p>
                    <img src="img/GameLauncher/GoogleDriveAPI.png" alt="Image 1">
                    <p class="project-text">
                        In the snippet you can see the entire code used for the Google Drive API
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p class="project-text">
                    The Google Drive API did not provide seamless support for downloading and extracting ZIP files
                    directly, which was a critical requirement for this project. This limitation hindered the smooth
                    retrieval and extraction of game files from the Google Drive repository.
                </p>




                <h3 class="project-text">Conclusion</h3>
                <p class="project-text">
                    We also had some trouble with files getting locked during the build process. It taught us the
                    importance of managing resources properly and handling file access carefully. We had to go deep
                    into
                    the build process to make sure nothing was causing problems.
                </p>
                <p class="project-text">

                    Despite these challenges, we adopted an iterative approach, did a lot of testing, and learned a
                    great deal about C# and the GitHub API. This project has really shown us the importance of
                    perseverance, creative problem-solving, and paying attention to detail, especially in a
                    college-level software development setting.
