                BO-Space was a group assignment given to Game Developers and Artists to develop a game in 8 weeks and
                see
                what they could make with their current skills.
                <br>
                I was in group 9. We worked on a Adventure Horror in game and as theme we had space.
                My part in this game was working on the AI and its behavior.
