                                            The Octo Monster project, our maiden venture into crafting a ground-based
                                            enemy,
                                            marked a significant milestone in my game development journey. This essay
                                            explores how this intriguing creature was conceived, developed, and refined.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            Creating an attacking monster for the first time was a challenge. We had to
                                            figure out where to begin, and that's when we dove into the realm of AI
                                            systems.
                                            Our objective was to breathe new life into the enemy AI, and it was no
                                            cakewalk.
                                            The ForceSystem (FS) added complexity to the mix, but after diligent
                                            exploration, we managed to decipher its inner workings.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            With a plan in place, my colleague, Jahvairo Monkau, and I collaborated
                                            effectively. We established a work plan that clearly outlined our
                                            responsibilities. I took charge of the coding while Jahvairo focused on the
                                            animator. What made our collaboration unique was our decision to switch
                                            roles
                                            every 1-2 hours, ensuring a balanced approach to the project.

                                            The Octo Monster operates in four distinct states:


                                            We kicked off the project by creating the Pathfinding script.
                                            Thanks to our understanding of the ForceSystem, this part was relatively
                                            smooth sailing. We even included a GIF to show how it all worked.

                                            <br>
                                            <br>

                                            Idle and Detection: We progressed swiftly with the Idle and Detection
                                            states. However, things got tricky when we tackled Fuzzy and Attacking.
                                            That's when we decided to bring in our Lead Developer, Berend, for help.
                                            It
                                            turned out that calling Attack and Fuzzy simultaneously caused an
                                            animator
                                            bug, and you can see it in the upper GIF.

                                            <br>
                                            <br>

                                            Attacking and Fuzzy States: These two states were pivotal in creating
                                            the
                                            Octo Monster's dynamic behavior. The Attacking state was designed to
                                            bring
                                            the creature to life during combat, while Fuzzy added an element of
                                            unpredictability to its actions.

                                            The visual appeal of the Octo Monster was crafted by Alex Kentie, who used
                                            VFX shaders to make its legs stand out. These legs not only bent
                                            automatically but were also easy to customize, adding a dash of visual
                                            sophistication to the Octo.

                                            In conclusion, our journey with the Octo Monster taught us valuable lessons
                                            in game development, particularly the importance of teamwork and creative

                                            Unity's shader system is like a magic spell for graphics in games. It's a
                                            special code that tells the graphics card how to paint pixels on the screen.
                                            Shaders have two main parts: Vertex Shaders move objects in 3D space, and
                                            Fragment Shaders color those objects in 2D. Unity makes it easier by giving
                                            us a visual editor to create shaders without needing to be a math wizard.
                                            So, with Unity shaders, you can make your games look awesome!

                                            <br>
                                            Man, diving into Unity shaders was no walk in the park, let me tell
                                            you. It's like this whole new language of graphics sorcery. I had to wrap my
                                            head around how these shaders, like, magically change the way things look on
                                            screen. It felt like preparing for a tough exam, with all those shader
                                            functions
                                            and syntax to memorize. But, you know what they say, the more you practice,
                                            the
                                            better you get, and now I can make things look really cool with shaders.

                                            The Radial Stamina bar serves as a substitute for the previous stamina
                                            system due to popular demand within our development team, inspired by the
                                            stamina bar in Zelda Breath of the Wild. This collaborative project was
                                            undertaken in partnership with Jahvario Monkau. Given that the stamina bar
                                            employs a shadergraph, it necessitated my acquisition of knowledge
                                            pertaining to shaders and their integration within the stamina bar
                                            implementation.

                                            manipulate graphics. It felt like deciphering a secret code. Then, I delved
                                            into the shader language and its functions, which was like deciphering
                                            complex instructions.

                                            There were moments of frustration when my shaders didn't work as intended,
                                            just like when you hit roadblocks with an assignment. But, with
                                            determination and lots of trial and error, I started to understand how to
                                            control colors, lighting, and textures.

                                            Finally, I realized that shaders were like crafting a unique artistic
                                            expression for each object in the game. It was a demanding journey, but in
                                            the end, it was incredibly rewarding to see how shaders transformed the
                                            visual aspect of the game.

                                            Creating a captivating combat system in the world of game development is no
                                            easy task. The birth of the Advanced Melee Weapon Combat System was a
                                            complex journey filled with challenges. This summary offers a glimpse into
                                            the obstacles I faced while building this intricate system, with a special
                                            focus on animation frames.

                                            My goal was to make the combat system feel like real swordfights. Animation
                                            frames were at the core of this vision. They acted as the timing for parry
                                            and block actions, like the beats in a song, making the combat feel
                                            authentic.

                                            In the next sections, we'll explore how I conceived and designed
                                            this system, and how animation frames played a crucial role in bringing it
                                            to life. We'll also touch on the challenges I encountered, as every big
                                            project comes with its hurdles. Throughout, remember that the magic of game
                                            development often lies in the balance between vision and execution, with
                                            animation frames being a key part of that equation.

                                            Parrying and blocking stood at the core of the system, each posing its
                                            unique coding challenges. It wasn't just about making them work; it was
                                            about coding them to align seamlessly with specific animation frames.
                                            Players had to grapple with these techniques. To make the combat system more
                                            engaging, I employed SphereCast within the code. This technique introduced a
                                            radius to parry and block actions, making the combat interactions dynamic
                                            and responsive.

                                            Controlling the player character through the PCombat script was a journey in
                                            itself. The code had to be orchestrated in such a way that parrying,
                                            blocking, and attacking could harmonize perfectly with the animation frames.
                                            The devil was indeed in the details.
