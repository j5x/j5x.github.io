                <p> Neon Game Studio is a project hosted by my college Mediacollege Amsterdam, where the students are working in an environment with their teachers on 1 big game
                    The main focus on Neon Game Studio is for the developers to improve at their chosen subject at a rapid rate.
                    I personally have learned alot from working on this project and improved my skills in 2 periods time.

                <p>I worked on the Octo drone, the modeling was done by my teacher <a href="https://nl.linkedin.com/in/alexkentie" target=”_blank”>Alex Kentie</a> he used VFX to model the legs to bend in any direction only ONCE.
                There was a AI system, but I reworked it with the help of <a href="https://nl.linkedin.com/in/experiencedesigner?trk=public_profile_browsemap" target="_blank">Berend Weij</a>
                I mainly reworked the old systems into newer, but reusable systems and made them work more comfortable with each other.</p>

                This is the octo currently in the game, after alot of tweaking and bug fixing he finally works in the game and is able to go to waypoints, switch states and attack the player.
                animations are triggered accordingly to the states.                </p>
